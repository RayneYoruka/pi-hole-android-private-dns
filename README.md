## Requirements
1. Ubuntu / Debain Based (Any Version)
2. Pi-Hole Installed With Web Server
3. Forward The Following Ports in TCP (`80,443,853`) to your Pihole instance.


## Installation
This is a simple script which requires 2 arguments
1. Domain Name To Run Android Private DNS Service Example: dns.myhomenetwork.net 
2. Email To Share with letsencrypt to get an SSL For Android Private DNS

### For Pihole 5/6 (Tested with Pihole V6 and works without issues)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RayneYoruka/pi-hole-android-private-dns/refs/heads/main/pi-hole-android-private-dns.sh
bash -x pi-hole-android-private-dns.sh
sudo bash pi-hole-android-private-dns.sh {domain_name} {email_for_letsencrypt}
```

**Example Run** `sudo bash pi-hole-android-private-dns.sh mydns.example.com myemail@gmail.com`


### **Notes on this:**
The script "does" use the HTTP-01 challenge for verification, for some uses/reasons it's very annoying since it needs both ports 80 and 443 open, which can lead in to issues. See: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/


If you own a domain you can simply use the DNS-01 challenge with: ```certbot -d example.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly```. This way you only need to create a TXT record when issuing a new certificate/renewing. I'd suggest only doing the TXT records when adding/renewing and just rinse and repeat.

I've seen being recommended [LEGO](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) but I have not yet tested it so I cannot say. 

### **Other notes:**
Since Lets Encrypt will be discontinuing the [Certificate renewal emails](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/22/ending-expiration-emails/) by June 4 2025, the simplest solution to monitor your certificate renewal date is to use [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) if you don't want to use LEGO or any automated method to renew your certificate as they can get *very tedious.*



### **Known issues:**
Every time you re-run the script to renew the certificates, a new line will be added to ```/etc/nginx/nginx.conf``` that needs to be removed manually. 

These duplicate line causes Nginx to not be able to start automatically after the script finishes to run.

The lines are:

    stream {
            include /etc/nginx/streams/*;
    }

Simply remove that line respecting the opening and the closing } and use ```sudo systemctl start nginx``` to solve the issue.
